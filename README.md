# C Programs Collection

A list of mini programs I developed purely using the low-level language C, which allowed me to strengthen my programming fundamentals, understandings, and practices. Programs include a game, change maker, finance forecaster, journaling app, and bank account ticketing system. These programs were made throughout my first term in the CPA program at Seneca College, between January 2021 and April 2021.
